fcType 				pv
fcTimeZone          UTC
fcTimeAhead         15 # total forecast time in minutes ahead

# forecast minute (horizon) to use; 0 is nowcast

loadProfSmooth      .02 # smooth factor to smooth out the profile. 0 as no smoothing and 0.99 as max smoothing

# ==== CONTROL SETUP =========
# Setting up control algorithm (none, local, distributed or centralized, etc.) between simulation steps
# Currently only support: 'none' and 'local'. Look into the simControl function for more info.
ctrlType            none 
ctrlHorizon         15 # ctrl time horizon in minutes. Default: 15 minutes assuming the use of sky imager forecasting for control
ctrlTStep           30 # ctrl time step in seconds. Default: 30 assuming the use of sky imager forecasting for control

# ==== Email notification ========

# Notification center (To send email to a list of recipients if something is not going right). This is used mostly in operational mode. Right now, it is used to check to make sure a ceilometer is running (at UCSD) or if a specific sky imager is capturing images
# Period of timeout before sending email
sendemail			0   # 1 for yes and 0 for no
emailtimeout		5	# in minutes
emaillist			changeThisEmail@noemail.com # seperate recipients by comma. Config this parameter in your local conf folder if you want to make it notify you.
